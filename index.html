      <h2>Monitoring Dynamic Change of Wetland</h2>

      <h3>Project carriers</h3>
      <p>
        Big Earth Data Science Engineering Project (CASEarth) SDG Working Group
      </p>
      <h3>Beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>
        The environment itself (flora and fauna, climate, etc.) and human beings
        (residents around the wetlands, fisheries, tourism, etc.).
      </p>
      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>Researchers and scientists</p>
      <h3>Need</h3>
      <p>
        The dynamic monitoring of the water bodies in the Ramsar Sites can
        directly or indirectly reflect the trend of changes and protection
        effect of the wetland ecosystem (Zheng et al., 2012). At present, there
        are 171 Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands
        committed to wetland conservation and management. By May 2020, there
        were 2 391 wetland reserves on the Ramsar Sites List, covering a land
        area of 2.53×106 km2.<br />The United Nations Water (UN-Water) has
        provided datasets related to SDG 6.6.1, including surface water,
        mangroves, reservoirs, and wetlands, based on the Global Surface Water
        Explorer (Pekel et al., 2016) and Global Lakes and Wetlands Database
        (Lehner and Doll, 2004) developed by the Joint Research Centre of the
        European Commission (JRC). However, there is no direct and comprehensive
        monitoring and evaluation of the ecological status of Ramsar Sites. The
        dynamic change of the water bodies in Ramsar Sites has a direct impact
        on the ecological environment of such reserves.
      </p>
      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p>
        This case study selected 86 representative inland Ramsar sites and their
        corresponding 51 basins in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The overall trend
        of changes in the water bodies and the inter-annual trend of variation
        within a year was analyzed using the least square linear regression
        method, and the significance level of the changes was tested through
        double tail t-test (0.05). According to the time series water body
        datasets, the water bodies were further divided into three types:
        permanent water bodies, seasonal water bodies, and temporary water
        bodies; their change trends were extracted through wavelet transform and
        time series decomposition method. Seven typical Ramsar sites of varying
        degrees of change were further selected for analysis and assessment of
        water body changes.

        Marine advocacy group Oceana, Google, SkyTruth, WWF, The Nature
        Conservancy (TNC)
      </p>
      <h3>Beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>
        Society. <br />There is growing evidence linking IUU fishing with
        migration, human and drugs trafficking, corruption and money laundering.
        It is also known to have negative impacts on food security, job creation
        and the development of coastal communities in general.
      </p>
      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>
        All stakeholders of global commercial fishing activity, including
        citizens, governments, fishery managers, scientists and members of the
        fishing industry itself.
      </p>
      <h3>Need</h3>
      <p>
        Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing has been depleting the
        world’s Fish populations for decades, despite concerted efforts from the
        global community to put an end to the practice.<br />
        Like any exchange on the black market, illegal fishing is difficult to
        monitor, analyse and tackle. And the most promising instrument in the
        fight against the illegal activity seems to be big data, and the global
        shipping fleet could potentially play a crucial role in helping monitor
        hard-to-spot rogue activity at sea.
      </p>
      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p>
        The platform tracks global fishing activity and analyses data from an
        automatic identification system (AIS), which broadcasts a ship’s
        identity, location, speed and direction. The AIS was initially designed
        as a safety mechanism to avoid collisions at sea and is currently used
        by 200,000 vessels around the world. With the help of a new algorithm
        developed by Global Fishing Watch, a vessel’s likely fishing behaviour
        can be detected in almost real-time.
        <br />Another initiative based around data compilation, which comes from
        Project Eyes on the Seas, is a technology platform that unites satellite
        monitoring and imagery data with fishing vessel databases and
        oceanographic data to help authorities detect suspicious fishing
        activity.

      <h2>Clean Water Sensoring</h2>

      <h3>Project carriers</h3>
      <p>Charity: water</p>
      <h3>Beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>People in rural areas and rely on small water systems.</p>
      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>Local government and water bureau.</p>
      <h3>Need</h3>
      <p>
        Historically, the only way for governments and NGOs to monitor rural
        water systems was to visit them. But reaching these locations takes
        time, human resources, and money. Given this reality, site visits occur
        only once or twice a year, meaning broken water systems can stay broken
        for months. If the system isn’t working, people immediately go back to
        drinking dirty water.
      </p>
      <h3>Principle</h3>
      <p>
        They developed a comprehensive remote monitoring tool using cutting-edge
        IoT (Internet of Things) sensors and cloud computing technology to equip
        local leaders with real-time data on water system performance. A
        handpump sensor is used as the tool to monitor the wells from afar. The
        handpump sensor lasts 10 years without a battery change, installs in 10
        minutes, is fully tamper-proof and vandal resistant, and uses the Amazon
        Web Services cloud computing platform to analyze readings in real time.
        The sensor’s roaming agreement automatically covers over 200 countries.
        <br />Deployment began in 2015. Today, thousands of these sensors are
        collecting data on our water projects. The sensors measure liters pumped
        per hour and can immediately identify any fluctuation in productivity.
        And if we observe a decrease in water flow—or a flow that stops
        altogether—a technician can be deployed to help make repairs.

      <h2>
        Name of Selected Project：Solutions of Nature Resources Management
      </h2>

      <h3>Carriers and Actors of the Project</h3>
      <p>
        Main Carriers: WIPO GREEN (mantain database); Other Actors: Research
        Instituition and University (provide data), Tech company in
        Natrual-resoure-related industry (pay for the data), government (data
        and patent governance)
      </p>
      <h3>Research Question</h3>
      <p>
        How can databases be used to help commercialize technologies for
        sustainable use of natural resources, balancing business interests and
        sustainable development?
      </p>
      <h3>Reason for the selection</h3>
      <p>
        I chose this project because I think it is needed and achievable by the
        real world (there are similar success stories).
        <br />
        First of all, in the sustainable use of natural resources are mainly
        faced with these problems.
        <li>
          Limited technological innovation capability of companies: Difficulty
          in technological research, shortage of advanced equipment resources,
          and shortage of high-end human resources can limit the development
          space of companies, which in turn limits their contribution to
          resource sustainability.
        </li>
        <li>
          High cost of purchasing technology and low profit: Usually, companies
          need to invest more money to purchase, experiment, and implement new
          solutions to achieve resource sustainability, but not enough profit
          from them, resulting in a lack of motivation to achieve SDG goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fragmented information: Fewer and less integrated channels of
          information on new technologies that are conducive to resource
          sustainability raise the cost for companies (users) to obtain
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          The need to realize research results: research institutes and schools
          have high-end academic talents who also have research results, and the
          difficulty of realizing them may bring a financial crisis to these
          institutions, which in turn reduces the output rate of innovation
          results.
        </li>
        <br />Since universities and research institutes have technology,
        talents and laboratories, and enterprises have production capacity and
        market channels, they can work together to form a complementary
        advantage, which can realize scientific and technological achievements
        quickly and thus support the realization of SDG goals. And WIPO can act
        as the builder of the cooperation platform. <br />However, how to build
        the journey of both sides in the process of cooperation with the help of
        database is a question we need to consider further.
      </p>
      <h2>User scenario</h2>
      <h3>Users</h3>
      <p>
        Researchers and scientists in companies, institutions, and
        non-governmental organizations.
      </p>
      <h3>Persona</h3>
      <p>
        <li>First name: Mia</li>
        <li>Age: 30</li>
        <li>Profession: Researcher of a water treatment company.</li>
        <li>Place of residence：London, Britain, City-centre</li>
        <li>Family status: middle class</li>
        <li>Income: 35000 Pounds per year</li>
        <li>
          Hobbies and passions: Fitness, meditation, gardening and her dog Lulu
        </li>
        <li>
          Needs, desires, dreams: Peaceful life, unity of body and mind, and
          dialogue with nature
        </li>
        <li>Problems and frustrations: She was both hopeful that her company would be profitable in treating and selling water, and concerned about the negative effects of water shortages and water pollution. On one trip, her dog Lulu took a few sips of river water and returned to her hotel at night with vomiting and diarrhea. Mia couldn't help but think of the times she spent playing with her buddies in the river as a child. Now, she just feels sad: even natural blood can be toxic now.</li>
        <li>Major issue related to the subject: Her boss discovered her concern for the natural environment while talking to her and wanted her to find a suitable technology to come up with a CSR solution for the company. mia was happy to do this and she thought it would make sense. However, she researched the Internet for a long time without finding the right technology: most of the information was fragmented and incomplete, and the contact information of the technical project leader seemed to have expired because she couldn't hear back from him (although she didn't want to bother anyone before the idea was formed). She felt the difficulty of gathering and identifying information and establishing contacts. This was a difficulty she had rarely encountered before. This is because her company's field is natural resource processing, and technical data in this area is usually managed by authoritative bodies, either in laboratories that rarely publish it, or with a high degree of confidentiality that prevents it from being freely disclosed.</li>

      <h2>Technical analysis</h2>
      <h3>General principle</h3>
      <p>The WIPO Green Database is a free, solution-oriented global innovation directory that links the need to solve natural resource problems, the need to commercialize scientific research results and sustainable solutions. The database consists primarily of user-initiated uploads of needs and solutions, content imported by WIPO from selected partner organizations, and user information.
        <br>Some of the unique features already available in the database are: consistent AI-assisted auto-matching, user upload tracking and alerts, full-text search of solutions based on long requirement descriptions, and the Patent2Solution search function, a commercial application for finding patents.
        <br>Subsequently we expect to optimize the collaboration journey to make it more user-friendly. For example, a built-in association function in the database to facilitate searches; a site letter function on the website to facilitate efficient and secure communication; and increased promotion of successful cases of industry and institute collaboration to create a community atmosphere for positive collaboration.

      <h3>Added value thanks to databases</h3>
      <p>
        With a database, data can be shared by multiple parties, reducing data
        redundancy, saving storage space, and avoiding incompatibility and
        inconsistency between data. Therefore, with the support of database, the
        cost of acquiring and processing information for users is reduced, while
        the autonomy and right to know are enhanced.
